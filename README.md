Hi, I'm Montserrat
I'm a Data Analyst who previously worked as a legal assistant. Technology has always caught my interest, and I had the opportunity to attend a Data Analysis bootcamp at Le Wagon, which I saw as a chance for growth and acquiring new skills. I love taking on new challenges, and the world of technology is vast and constantly changing, which is why I always stay updated with trends. This keeps me active and eager to learn new things. What interests me the most is the ability to creatively solve problems.
